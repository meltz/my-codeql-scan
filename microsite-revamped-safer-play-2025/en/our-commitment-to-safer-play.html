                Since Singapore Pools came into being on 23 May 1968, our mission has always been to counter illegal betting by providing a safe and trusted
                space for those who are incline to bet without them becoming victims of unfair practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we remain as Singapore's sole legal gaming operator for lottery, sports betting, and horse wagering. We continue to provide a safe and
                trusted space for our customers to place their bets, stemming leakages overseas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Singapore Pools is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Tote Board. As a not-for-profit organisation, we channel our revenue back to the local
                economy to support nation-building purposes, and all our surpluses to worthy causes to benefit the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond just contributing to the community via financial giving, Singapore Pools hopes to create shared value with the community by helping to
                drive transformational initiatives for the social service sector with knowledge and infrastructural capital.

              <p>
                In 2022, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has introduced the new Gambling Control Act 2022 to ensure that the laws and regulations in
                Singapore remain effective in the face of evolving gambling products and business models. With the new gambling legislative changes, the
                Gambling Regulation Authority (GRA) is established with the mandate to regulate the entire gambling landscape in Singapore.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 25 October 2022, Singapore Pools transited to become a Licensed Operator under the GRA. As a Licensee, Singapore Pools must comply with
                strict licensing conditions to offer a gambling service. They include mandatory social safeguards, strict advertisement and promotion protocols,
                and a comprehensive Responsible Gambling Programme (RGP).
              </p>
              <p>
                As the sole betting licensee for lottery, sports betting, and horse wagering, we take our responsibility to help shape a responsible gaming
                environment in Singapore seriously and do not take the public trust for granted.
